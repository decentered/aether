// Server > InspectTCP

// This is the Schr√∂dinger's cat of libraries. It allows you to observe what is going on coming from the wire in a net.Conn without actually changing its state nor causing it to be affected in any way. Internally, what it does is that it actually caches the read and at the first read from the outside, the already-read part is provided out, so to the external world, the connection appears undisturbed and unobserved.

// The second part, the listener uses this ability to inspect the connection, and if it's something that we are interested in, stop propagation of that into the http Server, and assume direct control of that TCP connection.
