// Explore is a function that reaches further into the network than our neighbourhood watch. At every call, it finds a live regular remote that is new to us and does a sync, and at the end it inserts it into our neighbourhood. At every 6 ticks, it syncs with our statics, and at every 36 ticks, it syncs with bootstrappers. An explore tick is not always a minute, it depends on the schedule, but it is something around 10 minutes. So that means refreshing statics every hour, and hitting bootstrappers every 6 hours.
