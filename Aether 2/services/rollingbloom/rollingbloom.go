// Services > RollingBloom
// This service provides a bloom filter that is time limited, in that you can ask 'have we seen this thing in the last x months?'

// The way this works is that you give this bloom filter a duration, and it makes it so that you can query for anything within that duration. Let's say it's 6 months. At any point in time, when you ask this filter, it will tell you whether what you're testing for is in the list, and how many total entries are in the bloom filter in total.

// What it cannot do is that you cannot tell this guy to give you the count of last 3 months when the filter was for 6 months. In exchange to that, the count this has is pessimistic and exact, in that it only adds to the bloom if we know for sure that it has not been put into the filter in the given timeframe. This means it might actually not add some data because it returned 'might be, might not be', so the count will always be lower than the real count. The diference between the real count and the count the filter reports increases as the bloom filter approaches its capacity, so you should have the filter about 10x the size you think you need. This is a bloom filter calculator that can give you an idea on how to set your values. https://hur.st/bloomfilter/ Mind that this count is for one filter, and rollingbloom creates duration / granularity. So if your duration is 30 days and granularity is 10 days, it'll be 3 bloom filters (+1 for the immediate future, so 4). That means if you set your capacity is 10000 at 50% false positive rate, your rolling bloom capacity is 30000 at 50% assuming a perfectly even distribution.

// This way of implementing a rolling bloom trades being able to query a specific time range within the bloom for exactitude on the lowest boundary. It might not count everything (but it will count 99%+ for most of its capacity), but it is guaranteed to not double count anything twice. This is useful for elections, which are conviction checks.

// There is another way to implement this which I'll probably also do, and that way, the bloom filter is capable of answering the queries on a limited, specific time range, not just its whole duration. That way, we always add it to the latest bloom without checking, but it doesn't have a count that increments. When the count query comes in, you union the bloom filters in the given time range, and do an estimation on the bloom filter to calculate the statistically most likely count number. This means the count number will be inexact, but you'll be able to get a count for any duration range within your covered total time range. That's more useful for population counts, which are existence checks.
