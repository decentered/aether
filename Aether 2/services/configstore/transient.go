#### NONCOMMITTED ITEMS

## PermConfigReadOnly
When enabled, this prevents anything from saved into the config. This value itself is NOT saved into the config, so when the application restarts, this value is reset to false. This is useful in the case that you provide flags to the executable, but you don't want the values in the flags to be permanently saved into the config file. Any flags being provided into the executable will set this to true, therefore any runs with flags will effectively treat the config as read-only.

## AppIdentifier
This is the name of the app as registered to the operating system. This is useful to have here, because what we can do is we can vary this number in the swarm testing (petridish) and each of these nodes will act like a network in a single local machine, each with their own databases and different config files.

## OrgIdentifier
Same as above, but it's probably best to keep it under the same org name just to keep the local machine clean.

## PrintToStdout
This is useful because the logging things the normal kind does not pass the output to the swarm test orchestrator. This flag being enabled routes the logs to stdout so that the orchestrator can show it.

## MetricsDebugMode
This being enabled temporarily makes this node send much more detailed metrics more frequently, so that network connectivity issues can be debugged. This is a transient config on purpose, so that this cannot be enabled permanently. If a frontend connects to a backend with debug mode enabled, it has to show a warning to its user that says this backend node has debugging enabled, and only connect if the user agrees. Mind that the backend doesn't have to be truthful about whether it has the debug mode on. Having this mode on does not immediately compromise the frontend's privacy / identity, but the longer the frontend stays on that backend and the more actions a user commits, the higher the likelihood.

## ExternalPortVerified
Whether the port that was in the config was actually checked to be free and clear. This is important because we'll check once before the server starts to run, and when it starts, that port will no longer be available, and will start to return 'not available'. That will make all subsequent checks fail and that will trigger the port to be moved to a port that is free - but not bound to any server, since the server is bound to the old port, and that in fact is the reason the checks return false.

## SwarmNodeId
This is the number that this specific node will route to the main swarm orchestrator when it's reporting logs. Make sure that the App identifier (Usually in the format of "Aether-N") matches this number N, or it can be confusing.

## ShutdownInitiated
This is set when the shutdown of the backend service is initiated. The processes that take a long time to return should be checking this value periodically, and if it is set, they should stop whatever they're doing and do a graceful shutdown.

## LameduckInitiated
In this mode, the node starts to decline any inbound and outbound requests as well as reverse connections. This is effectively a way to prepare the node for an orderly shutdown. It will finish writing whatever db write it needs to do, and whenever that is done, shutdown can be initiated safely.

## DispatcherExclusions
This is the temporary exclusions for the dispatcher. When you connect to a node, that node is placed in the exclusions list for a while, so that you don't repeatedly keep connecting back to that node again.


## StopAddressScannerCycle
This is the channel to send the message to when you want to stop the address scanner repeated task.

## StopUPNPCycle
This is the channel to send the message to when you want to stop the UPNP mapper repeated task.

## StopCacheGenerationCycle
This is the channel to send the message to when you want to stop the cache generator repeated task.

## AddressesScannerActive
This is the mutex that gets activated when the address scanner is active, so that it cannot be triggered twice at the same time.

## SyncActive
There is currently an ongoing sync happening.

## CurrentMetricsPage
This is the current metrics struct that we are building to send to the metrics server, if enabled.

## ConfigMutex
This is the mutex that prevents configuration from being written from multiple places.

## FingerprintCheckEnabled
Determines whether the entities coming over from the wire are fingerprint-checked for integrity.

## SignatureCheckEnabled
Determines whether the entities coming over from the wire are signature-checked for ownership.

## ProofOfWorkCheckEnabled
Determines whether the entities coming over from the wire are PoW-checked for anti-spam.

## PageSignatureCheckEnabled
Determines whether the pages (entity containers) coming over from the wire are signature-checked for integrity.

## EntityVersions
These are the versions of the entities that we can issue in this version of the app. Mind that this is for issuance, not for acceptance - we should still accept older versions gracefully.

# POSTResponseRepo
This is the repository that we keep our post responses in, so that they can be reused. This resets at every restart.

# NeighboursList
Our list of neighbours that we are checking in with at given intervals.

# Bouncer
Bouncer controls the inbound and outbound connections. This is the library that starts to refuse connections if the node gets too busy.

# ReverseConnData
This is the place we use to save the data so that we know an inbound connection is a reverse-opened one.

# Nonces
This is the library that keeps track of nonces for us.

# NewContentCommitted
We flip this flag to true whenever the users (frontends) of this backend send us new content. It triggers a reverse connection request at the first opportunity, so that the new content can spread to the network as soon as possible. It then flips itself to false after a reverse connection.

# MinimumTrustedPoWStrength
This is the PoW strength we ask for trusted entities coming from a CA that this node has explicitly chosen to trust.

/*

# RefresherCacheNowTimestamp
This is the synchronised end timestamp for all things related to refreshing the FE. Why is this needed? Because the way FE cache works is that we pull all the necessary data into the frontend first as a whole to minimise the number of back and forths between the frontend and the backend.

That means, though, when that cache is queried, the last piece of data that is available on the cache will be the now() at the time of the beginning of the cache query (t1). That means if you query the cache at t2 and save it as now() of your query of the cache, you'll have the data from t1, but you'll timestamp it as t2, which means the next time you query, you'll start from t1, not t2, missing the data between t1 and t2.

To prevent that, at the beginning of a refresh cycle, the first thing that happens is pull-all-data-from-be event, and that event supplies a cache end timestamp. Anything that happens inside the refresh cycle assumes that timestamp is now() for all intents and purposes.
