// Address update insert is mutable. This is used when the node connects to the address itself. Example: When a node connects to 256.253.231.123:8080, it will update the entry for that address with the data coming from the remote node. This is the only way to mutate an address object.

/* In the WHERE clause below, we do not check for inequivalency of location, sublocation and port because we do the join based on that, they're guaranteed to be the same. We are also explicitly NOT checking for the local arrival being different because this is the entire point of this comparison: if the only thing that changes is the local arrival, we do NOT insert.

Why?

Because a static node's LastSuccessfulSync only gets updated to its timestamp. That means LastSuccessfulSync can actually be in the past. If we generate responses and caches based on LastSuccessfulSync, what happens is that it might actually be placed outside that cache's or responses scope, and in the scope of caches / responses that are already generated. Which effectively means it won't be communicated.

If we do the opposite, and scan based on localarrival, then every time a node is communicated with, the localarrival will update. Even when there are no updates. That means when a static node is hit, it will be placed to the top of the list of addresses that node has connected to and will be served at the top. Considering that static nodes stay online 24/7, this will cause the addresses list that this node serves to be mostly / all made of static nodes.

To prevent that, what we do is that every time LastSuccessfulSync changes in an address we update the localarrival, but ONLY then. If anything changes in an address except localarrival then we update localarrival as well as the changes, but if it's just localarrival change and nothing else, then we do not update.

This solves our problem, because if a static node is updated, the LastSuccessfulSync will be set to its timestamp and the localarrival will be set to now. since we scan by localarrival, it is guaranteed to be included in the response, but so long as the LastSuccessfulSync does not change, that will be it. It won't update every time the node is connected to.
